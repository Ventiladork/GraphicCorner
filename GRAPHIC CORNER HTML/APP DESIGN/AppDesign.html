The vector graphics technique is a standard and is mainly used to create highly detailed compositions that someone will later convert into classic image formats.</li>
                              <li><b>Powerful layer system:</b> Of course, it features the so much powerful layer system that allows you to create complex and compelling images. Using the layers, you can create your composition step by step, apply actions on one or several layers, combine them with the valuable clipping mask system, and lots more.</li>
                              <li><b>Countless tools:</b> You will be able to use many different tools to create and edit your illustrations, including selection tools, zoom, and pan tools, drawing, painting, text tools, and lots more.

                              <li><b>Workspaces:</b> You can create and manipulate your creations using different elements such as panels, bars, and windows. The arrangement of these elements is known as a "workspace". These workspaces can be adapted to your liking, selecting one of the preset formats or generating a customized one.</li>
                              <li><b>Extend and automatize:</b> Adobe Illustrator lets you create scripts and more to automatize repetitive tasks and create new routines. Routines can automatically apply a series of actions to every image on a folder, place random objects on a layer, and even more.</li>
